# Fix Vapi Integration - Replace n8n with Your Existing System

## üéØ **Current Problem:**
- n8n is double-booking time slots
- n8n doesn't check your existing bookings properly
- n8n doesn't respect business hours

## üîß **Solution:**
Replace n8n with your existing Google Calendar integration that already works properly.

## üìã **Step 1: Update Vapi Webhook URL**

### **In Vapi Dashboard:**
1. **Go to**: Your assistant settings
2. **Change webhook URL from**: `https://your-n8n-url/webhook/...`
3. **To**: `https://www.reevacar.com/api/vapi/webhook`

### **In Twilio Console:**
Your Twilio number `+1 617 882 7958` is correctly pointing to:
```
https://api.vapi.ai/twilio/inbound_call
```
This is correct - don't change this.

## üìã **Step 2: Configure Vapi Functions**

In your Vapi assistant, add these functions:

### **Function 1: Check Availability**
- **Name**: `check_availability`
- **Description**: `Check if a specific date and time is available for booking`
- **Parameters**:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "date": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Date in YYYY-MM-DD format"
    },
    "time": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Time in HH:MM format (24-hour)"
    }
  },
  "required": ["date", "time"]
}
```

### **Function 2: Create Booking**
- **Name**: `create_booking`
- **Description**: `Create a new booking/appointment`
- **Parameters**:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "customerName": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Customer full name"
    },
    "customerPhone": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Customer phone number"
    },
    "vehicleMake": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Vehicle make (e.g., Toyota, Honda)"
    },
    "vehicleModel": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Vehicle model (e.g., Camry, Civic)"
    },
    "vehicleYear": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Vehicle year"
    },
    "services": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" },
      "description": "List of services requested"
    },
    "scheduledDate": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Scheduled date in YYYY-MM-DD format"
    },
    "scheduledTime": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Scheduled time in HH:MM format"
    },
    "address": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Service location address"
    }
  },
  "required": ["customerName", "customerPhone", "vehicleMake", "vehicleModel", "vehicleYear", "services", "scheduledDate", "scheduledTime"]
}
```

## üìã **Step 3: Update System Prompt**

Replace your current system prompt with:

```
You are the AI assistant for Brooks Car Care, a car detailing business.

Available services: Car Wash, Interior Detail, Exterior Detail, Full Detail, Waxing, Paint Correction

You're having a natural phone conversation with a customer. Be friendly, helpful, and conversational.

When booking appointments, collect:
- Customer name and phone number
- Vehicle make, model, and year
- Preferred date and time
- Services needed
- Location/address

Use the available functions to check calendar availability and create bookings.

Be conversational and natural - not robotic. Show enthusiasm and be helpful.

IMPORTANT: You're using ElevenLabs voice synthesis, so speak naturally with:
- Natural pauses and breathing
- Appropriate tone changes
- Conversational flow
- Professional but friendly demeanor
```

## üìã **Step 4: Test the Integration**

### **4.1 Test the Webhook**
1. **Call**: `+1 617 882 7958`
2. **Say**: "Hi, I'd like to book a car wash for tomorrow at 2pm"
3. **Check**: Your app logs to see if the webhook is being called

### **4.2 Test Availability Check**
1. **Say**: "Is tomorrow at 2pm available?"
2. **The AI should**: Check your existing bookings and business hours
3. **Verify**: It's not double-booking

### **4.3 Test Booking Creation**
1. **Say**: "I want to book an appointment"
2. **Provide details**: Name, phone, vehicle, services, date/time
3. **Check**: Your Google Calendar for the new event
4. **Check**: Your detailer dashboard for the new booking

## üéØ **How This Fixes the n8n Problems:**

2. **Twilio forwards** to Vapi
3. **Vapi processes** speech with ChatGPT
4. **ElevenLabs** provides natural voice
5. **Vapi calls** your webhook for availability/booking
6. **Your app** checks existing bookings and business hours
7. **Your app** creates booking and syncs to Google Calendar
8. **Customer gets** confirmation

## üìä **Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **No more double-booking** - uses your existing booking logic

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

1. **Update Vapi webhook URL** to point to your app
2. **Add the functions** in Vapi
3. **Test the integration** by calling the number
4. **Monitor** for any issues
5. **Remove n8n** once everything is working
