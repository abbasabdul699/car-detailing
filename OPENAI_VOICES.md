Your system is now configured to use **`alloy`** (neutral, balanced voice) by default.

## üß™ **How to Test Different Voices**

To test a different voice, just tell me which one you'd like to try:

- "Try the echo voice" (warm male)
- "Try the nova voice" (energetic female) 
- "Try the onyx voice" (deep male)
- "Try the shimmer voice" (gentle female)
- "Try the fable voice" (British accent)

## üîß **How It Works**

1. **AI generates response** using GPT-3.5-turbo
2. **OpenAI TTS converts** text to natural speech
3. **Twilio plays** the generated audio to caller
4. **Fallback system** uses Twilio voice if OpenAI fails
