# Booking Completion System Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The **Detailer Starter** plan uses a **pay-per-booking** model where detailers are charged $3 for each completed booking. This system automatically tracks booking completion and charges detailers accordingly.

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Simple Completion Logic:**
1. **Appointment scheduled** → Status: `scheduled`
2. **Appointment time passes** → System checks status
3. **If not cancelled/rescheduled** → Status: `completed`
4. **Charge $3 fee** → Automatically deducted from detailer's earnings

### **Anti-Fraud Protection:**
- **Customer reviews/ratings** = Natural confirmation system
- **If customer leaves review** → Confirms service happened
- **If no review after 48 hours** → Still considered completed (appointment wasn't cancelled)

## 🛠️ System Components

### **1. Database Models:**
- **`Charge`** - Tracks pay-per-booking fees
- **`Booking`** - Tracks appointment status
- **`Subscription`** - Determines if detailer is on Starter plan

### **2. API Endpoints:**
- **`/api/cron/process-bookings`** - Processes completed bookings (runs hourly)

### **3. Services:**
- **`BookingCompletionService`** - Handles completion logic
- **`StripeSubscriptionService`** - Manages subscriptions

## 📊 Current Status

### **Detailers:**
- **Brooks Car Care** - First Cohort ✅
- **Spade Detailing** - First Cohort ✅
- **Both on trial** (no active subscriptions yet)

### **Bookings:**
- **5 cancelled bookings** found
- **No completed bookings** yet
- **No charges** processed yet

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### **1. Set Up Cron Job:**
```bash
# Add to your Vercel cron jobs or external service
# Runs every hour to process completed bookings
POST https://reevacar.com/api/cron/process-bookings
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

### **2. Environment Variables:**
```bash
CRON_SECRET=your_secure_cron_secret_here
```

### **3. Test the System:**
```bash
# Test booking completion
node scripts/test-booking-completion.js

# Process completed bookings manually
curl -X POST https://reevacar.com/api/cron/process-bookings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

## 💰 Billing Logic

### **Detailer Starter Plan:**
- **$3 per completed booking**
- **Only charged for completed bookings**
- **No monthly subscription fee**

### **Detailer Pro Plan:**
- **$300/month** (or $255 for first cohort)
- **Unlimited bookings**
- **No per-booking charges**

## 🔧 Manual Testing

### **Create Test Booking:**
1. **Create a booking** with appointment time in the past
2. **Ensure booking status** is `scheduled`
3. **Run the completion processor**
4. **Check if booking** is marked as `completed`
5. **Verify charge** is created for Starter plan detailers

### **Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ **Completed booking** → Charge $3
- ✅ **Cancelled booking** → No charge
- ✅ **Pro plan detailer** → No per-booking charge
- ✅ **Trial period** → No charges

## 📈 Monitoring

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Completed bookings** per day/week
- **Charges processed** per detailer
- **Revenue from pay-per-booking** fees
- **Detailer conversion** from Starter to Pro

### **Dashboard Views:**
- **Detailer Dashboard** → Shows charges and earnings
- **Admin Dashboard** → Shows all charges and revenue
- **Stripe Dashboard** → Shows payment processing

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Bookings not completing** → Check appointment time vs current time
2. **Charges not processing** → Check detailer's subscription plan
3. **Cron job failing** → Check CRON_SECRET and endpoint URL

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check booking status
node scripts/test-booking-completion.js

# Check detailer subscriptions
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/subscription/status

# Check charges
node -e "
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
prisma.charge.findMany().then(charges => {
  console.log('Charges:', charges);
  prisma.\$disconnect();
});
"
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up cron job** for automatic processing
2. **Test with real bookings** 
3. **Monitor charge processing**
4. **Add customer review system** for additional confirmation
5. **Create admin dashboard** for charge management
