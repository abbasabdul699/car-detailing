You're having a natural phone conversation with a customer. Be friendly, helpful, and conversational.

When booking appointments, collect:
- Customer name and phone number

Use the available functions to check calendar availability and create bookings.

Be conversational and natural - not robotic. Show enthusiasm and be helpful.

- Conversational flow
- Professional but friendly demeanor
```

### **1.6 Configure Voice Settings (ElevenLabs)**

**Voice Provider**: `ElevenLabs`  
**Voice**: Choose your preferred ElevenLabs voice (e.g., `Adam`, `Sarah`, `Rachel`)  
**Speech Rate**: `1.0` (normal speed)  
**Voice Settings**: 
- **Stability**: `0.5` (balanced between consistent and expressive)
- **Clarity**: `0.75` (clear speech)
- **Style**: `0.3` (slightly expressive but professional)

**Note**: ElevenLabs provides much better voice quality than Twilio's default voices, giving your AI a more natural and professional sound.

#### **ElevenLabs Voice Selection Tips:**

**For Car Detailing Business:**
- **Male voices**: `Adam`, `Antoni`, `Arnold` (professional, friendly)
- **Female voices**: `Sarah`, `Rachel`, `Bella` (warm, approachable)
- **Professional voices**: `Josh`, `Daniel` (authoritative, trustworthy)

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Adam**: Warm, professional, good for customer service
- **Sarah**: Clear, friendly, great for phone calls
- **Rachel**: Natural, conversational, very human-like
- **Antoni**: Deep, confident, good for business calls

### **1.7 Set Phone Number**

**Phone Number**: Use your Vapi phone number (the one customers will call)

## üìã **Step 2: Environment Variables**

### **2.1 Phone Number Setup**

**Important**: Vapi uses Twilio phone numbers, not its own phone numbers.

1. **Get a Twilio phone number** (if you don't have one)
2. **Configure that Twilio number in Vapi**
3. **Make sure your detailer record has the same Twilio number**

### **2.2 Verify Your Detailer Record**

Make sure your detailer record in the database has:
- `twilioPhoneNumber` matching your Twilio number used in Vapi
- `googleCalendarConnected: true`
- Valid Google Calendar tokens

### **2.3 Environment Variables**

You don't need a separate `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER` variable. The system will use your existing `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` environment variable.

### **2.4 ElevenLabs Configuration**

**In Vapi Dashboard:**
1. **Go to Voice settings**
2. **Select ElevenLabs as provider**
3. **Choose your preferred voice** (Adam, Sarah, Rachel, etc.)
4. **Set voice parameters**:
   - **Stability**: `0.5` (balanced)
   - **Clarity**: `0.75` (clear speech)
   - **Style**: `0.3` (slightly expressive)

**ElevenLabs API Key**: Make sure you have a valid ElevenLabs API key configured in Vapi for voice synthesis.

## üìã **Step 3: Test the Integration**

### **3.1 Test the Webhook**

1. **Call your Vapi number**
2. **Say**: "Hi, I'd like to book a car wash for tomorrow at 2pm"
3. **Check your logs** to see if the webhook is being called

### **3.2 Test Availability Check**

1. **Say**: "Is tomorrow at 2pm available?"
2. **The AI should**: Check your Google Calendar and respond
3. **Check your Google Calendar** to see if it's actually checking

### **3.3 Test Booking Creation**

1. **Say**: "I want to book an appointment"
2. **Provide details**: Name, phone, vehicle, services, date/time
3. **Check your Google Calendar** for the new event
4. **Check your detailer dashboard** for the new booking

## üéôÔ∏è **Example Conversation Flow**

```
Customer: *calls +1234567890*
AI: "Hi! Thanks for calling Brooks Car Care. How can I help you today?"

Customer: "I need a car wash for tomorrow at 2pm"
AI: "Great! Let me check if that time is available... *calls check_availability function* Yes, 2pm tomorrow is available! What's your name?"

Customer: "John Smith"
AI: "Perfect! What's your phone number?"

Customer: "555-123-4567"
AI: "Great! What kind of car do you have?"

Customer: "2020 Toyota Camry"
AI: "Excellent! What services do you need?"

Customer: "Just a basic wash"
AI: "Perfect! Let me book that for you... *calls create_booking function* Done! I've booked your basic wash for your 2020 Toyota Camry tomorrow at 2pm. You'll get a confirmation text shortly. Anything else I can help with?"
```

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "Detailer not found"**
- **Check**: Your Twilio phone number in Vapi matches your detailer's `twilioPhoneNumber`
- **Check**: Your detailer record exists in the database
- **Check**: The `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` environment variable is set correctly

### **Issue: Availability check fails**
- **Check**: Your detailer has Google Calendar connected
- **Check**: Google Calendar tokens are valid
- **Check**: Your webhook is receiving the function calls

### **Issue: Booking creation fails**

### **Issue: No response from AI**

## üìä **Monitoring**

1. **Vapi Dashboard**: Check call logs and function calls
2. **Your App Logs**: Check webhook processing

4. **Detailer Dashboard**: Check for new bookings

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Setup**

1. **Test thoroughly** with different scenarios
2. **Monitor the first few calls** for any issues
3. **Adjust the system prompt** if needed
4. **Add more services** to the available services list
5. **Consider adding more functions** (like rescheduling, cancellation)

The key is making sure the phone number in your environment variable matches the phone number in your detailer record, and that your detailer has Google Calendar connected.
